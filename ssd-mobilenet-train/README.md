# SSD MobileNet Training Project

This project implements a training pipeline for the combined SSD MobileNet model. The model is designed for object detection tasks and leverages the strengths of both the SSD architecture and MobileNet for efficient performance.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ssd-mobilenet-train
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To train the SSD MobileNet model, run the following command:
```bash
python src/train.py
```

## Model Information

The SSD MobileNet model combines the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) architecture with MobileNet as the backbone. This allows for efficient object detection with a smaller model size and faster inference times.

## Dataset

Ensure that your dataset is properly formatted and accessible. The `dataset.py` file handles loading and preprocessing of the training data, including data augmentation techniques.
